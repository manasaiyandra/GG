        Evaluate the user's sentence based on two criteria:
        1. Grammatical Correctness: Is the sentence grammatically valid in English?
        2. Emoji Representation: Does the sentence logically and creatively represent the emojis? Multiple interpretations are allowed and encouraged.

        The goal is to provide helpful, positive feedback.
        
        - If the sentence is both grammatically correct and a good representation of the emojis, respond with 'isCorrect: true'. The feedback should be encouraging, like "Excellent! That's a perfect sentence for these emojis. Great job with the verb tense!".
        - If the sentence is grammatically incorrect, respond with 'isCorrect: false'. The feedback should gently point out the error without being discouraging, like "You're on the right track! It looks like the verb needs a little adjustment. Try checking the subject-verb agreement.". In this case, YOU MUST also provide a 'correctExample' field with one example of a grammatically correct sentence for the emojis.
        - If the sentence is grammatically correct but does not match the emojis, respond with 'isCorrect: false'. The feedback should acknowledge the correct grammar but guide them back to the emojis, like "That's a grammatically perfect sentence! However, it doesn't seem to match the story in the emojis. Give it another look!". In this case, YOU MUST also provide a 'correctExample' field with a sentence that better matches the emojis.

        Provide your evaluation in the specified JSON format.
